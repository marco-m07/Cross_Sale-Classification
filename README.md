# Cross-Sale_Classification

The aim of this project is to use Supervised Machine Learning techniques on a dataset representing clients of an insurance company that have suscribed an health insurance in order to predict if they could be interested in a vehicle insurance provided by the same company.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ishandutta/analytics-vidhya-insurance-cross-sell-prediction

# Steps

The workflow has been the following:
  - Data Exploration
  - Data Pre-processing
  - Application of Classification Models 
    - Classification Tree 
    - Random Forest 
    - Naive Bayesian Classifier 
    - Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier
    - AdaBoost

# Evaluation

In order to select the best model we have only focused on the best F1 score on Test data just for the sake of simplicity. We are aware that other considerations must be put into place in order to evaluate the best model.

The final results have shown that the Classification Tree model is the best performing with respect to F1.
